# Overall (94/100)
 - Excellent git history... appropriate size and number of commits
 - Be sure to edit the report for grammar more thoroughly in the future:
   consider relying on peer-review to help in this area!

# Build (9/10)
 - Good build instructions, including the python 3 requirement. In the future,
   may want to specify more info about the environment (e.g. dependencies like
   lmfit and statsmodels)
 - Typically, you want your analysis to be completely automated; i.e. it 
   shouldn't require any clicking from the user to close plots etc. Consider
   having multiple keywords in the `Makefile`, e.g. `make analysis` to 
   generate and save the plots, or `make show` to allow the user to view the
   generated plots interactively.

# Testing (10/10)
 - No tests implemented... okay for now, may want to practice!

# Intro / Background / Motivation (15/15)
 - Adequate description for lab 0
 - For real labs, make sure to emphasize both the what and the why

# Methods (15/15)
 - Good focus and appropriate level of detail; i.e. peak finding and fitting
   algorithms

# Results and discussion (35/40)
 - Nice figures and tables... displaying relevant info and well-labelled.
 - Should have some discussion of uncertainty... what are the sources? How do
   they compare to the degrees of precision we are concerned with for this
   application?

# Conclusion (10/10)
 - Though you don't have an explicit conclusion section, the info in the 
   discussion section is appropriate. For future labs, this should be expanded.
