	The code developed for the energy peak fitting has a number of limitations. Notabely, the code relies on finding the max point in the spectrum inorder to locate the peaks. This was only possible because of visual inspection of the spectrums confirmed that this could be done. Additionally, the width size of the peaks are predetermined meaning that if one is not careful, it is possible to combine two peaks into one or even delete a peak. The method used for fitting the peaks also requires an extra step of fitting a linear model and adding it to the gaussian fit inorder to avoid incorrect curve fitting. However, the energy calibration does fit very well. The coefficient of determination for the linear fit is .99 showing a high degree of correlation.
