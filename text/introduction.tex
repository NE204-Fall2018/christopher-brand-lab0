	The ability Accurate radiation energy spectrums are essential to further our understanding of nuclear physics. To achieve this it is essential to produce exact energy calibrations. This is especially true for High Purity Germanium Detectors (HPGe) that are able to achieve high-energy resolution beyond what other detectors, such as scintillators, are capable of. Due to the importance associated with the energy calibration, it is necessary to develop a fundamental understanding of the process of associating the bins with energy as well as the skills to develop the process used for performing energy calibrations. To this end, a count rate dataset of 5 known sources were provided to calibrate and subsequently verify the quality of the fit.
