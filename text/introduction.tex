In gamma-ray spectroscopy, determining which gamma-rays are present is an important aspect of
radiation detection, and by performing an energy calibration, the identification of
of these gamma-ray energies becomes easier. With High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors, the peaks of the gamma-rays
are easily discernible allowing for the centroid of the peak to be identified  
what gamma-ray energies are present.
Gaussian distribution show up all over the place in nature.
The reason for this is well known,
and often attributed to the Central Limit theorem. blah blah blah blah
